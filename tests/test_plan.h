 *	REQUIRE:  a condition that has to hold, printed before it is checked -
 *		  on a failure the last REQUIRE is the one that did not hold
 *	CHECK:    the check of a REQUIRE as written in the code in [], its
 *		  verdict, "is ok" or "has failed", and the actual value it

 *	RUNUNTIL: a repeated action and the condition that ends it
 *
 * Flushed right away, so the markers stay in order with the log output and
